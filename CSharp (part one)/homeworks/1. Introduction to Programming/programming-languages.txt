1.Java

Java is a class-based, object-oriented language specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
The main difference is that Java can be run on any operating system, while C# typically requires Windows and the .NET framework.
There are also mostly minor differences in keywords and syntax and in the use of some classes, exception handling etc.

2.C

C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications.
Originally intended for writing system software, 
C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s.

3. Python

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as
 C++ or Java.
Python projects are often open-source, web-based, and/or cross-platform. Python has a larger user base on mac and unix-based 
platforms.
C# projects are often proprietary, windows-based applications. There's very few non-windows C# projects.

4. JavaScript


JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that is most commonly used as part of web browsers, 
whose implementations allow client-side
scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content 
that is displayed.

5. PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
The major differences between PHP and C# is that PHP is a dynamic and interpreted while C# is static and needs to be compiled.
