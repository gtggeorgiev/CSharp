C# and .NET Differences

.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model and you 
can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other 
languages to write .NET applications.
